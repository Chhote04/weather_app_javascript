# Weather App

The Weather App is a simple web application that allows users to retrieve weather information for a specific city. Users can enter the name of a city, and the app will display the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. If an invalid city name is entered, the app will display an error message indicating that the city is not found.

## How to Use the Weather App

1. Clone the Repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git
   ```

2. Open the "index.html" File:

   Navigate to the project directory and open the "index.html" file in your preferred web browser. The app will load on the browser, and you will see a search input field and a search button.

3. Search for a City:

   Enter the name of any city in the search input field and click the search button (magnifying glass icon). The app will fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and display the weather information for the specified city.

4. View Weather Information:

   Once the app retrieves the weather data successfully, you will see the following information displayed on the screen:

   - **City Name**: The name of the city for which weather information is displayed.
   - **Temperature**: The current temperature in Celsius.
   - **Humidity**: The percentage of humidity in the air.
   - **Wind Speed**: The wind speed in kilometers per hour.
   - **Weather Icon**: An icon representing the current weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy, etc.).

5. Handling Invalid City Name:

   If you enter an invalid city name or a city that does not exist, the app will display an error message stating "Invalid City Name." Please make sure to check the spelling and verify that the city you entered exists.
